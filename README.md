**Project Description**  
A program that stares right back at you! This project uses OpenCV to detect faces and eyes in an image and draw boxes around them, because why not?  

---

## The Problem (that doesn‚Äôt exist)  
Have you ever looked at a photo and thought,  
*"Wow, I really wish I knew where the eyes and face were‚Ä¶"*?  
No? Well, we solved it anyway.  

---

## The Solution (that nobody asked for)  
We built a Python program that finds your face in an image, finds your eyes in that face, and surrounds them with colorful boxes. Now you can rest easy knowing that rectangles are watching you back.
